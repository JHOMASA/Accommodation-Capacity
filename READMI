** Dashboard analysis

During a deeply review to the dataset, one of the main considerations as the people search before arriving to a new place is the accomodation. For that reason two of the most 
important factors that the people considerate are what locations have the highest preference for the inmigrants and what of those are not considered. In the case of the highest 
lowest preference Unternehmen represent the lowest one, and on the other side Baugewerbe shows the highest preference for the people. In the case of the inmigrations, men inmigrations
represent slighly the highest amount during 2020 and the tendency was mantaining on the same way on the previous years, but the most notorious number of inmigrants was
in 1990 because more men population represented the highest number of inmigrations. In the case of the top 10 countries that have the considerable number of inmigrants were
Polonia, Turkey, Russia, Kazajistan, Siria, Italia, Rumania, Chequia, Grecia, and Croatia.
